## Overview
The **Rifleman** is the most common class among the Infantry units; it is versatile and much stronger when deployed in large groups.
They are not necessarily units that must assault the enemy front, but they can provide support to tanks and other classes that would not be very effective alone.
They have mainly ranged weapons, with the ability to focus on one or more units at a time to maximize their attack based on needs.
