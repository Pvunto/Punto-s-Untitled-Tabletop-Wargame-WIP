## Overview
The **Assault** is the second most common class among Infantry units. It is versatile and can be specialized to satisfy specific roles, such as automatic rifleman or machine gunner.
It performs best when paired with other classes, but Assault units can also form an effective squad on their own. They are equipped with weapons suitable for both long-range engagements and close-quarters combat.
