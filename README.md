# Introduction
This **Tabletop Wargame** was created to allow both experienced and novice players to participate in a simple and  **customizable**  experience. 
Everything written in these files is not holy text but *can be modified at will by players* without any problems.
Each part is created to allow miniatures from different universes to interact in a way that is *balanced* for all players.

Two to four players can play without any problems.

***If any rules are changed, players must be notified before the game begins.***

## Why
This game was created to give more freedom to players, more opportunities for expansion for role-players, more opportunities and simpler rules for those who like competitive gaming, and the possibility of clashing multiple armies from multiple universes where the players decide whether to have a fair fight or a more realistic fight.

## Who am I
I'm Punto, am just an Italian student passionate about an incredible number of things, one of which is Warhammer 40K and Trench Crusade. I've always been fascinated by World War I and II, and I've always wanted a board game that would allow me to play with both universes, with simple, clear rules that are always open to expansion or change, creating a dynamic playstyle that doesn't overwhelm new players with hundreds of specialized rules right from the start.

That said, this project is a personal thing that I'll probably share with the world one day. This repo is always evolving, but I'll create releases with PDFs of the most complete versions to make the rules and datasheets easier to read.

## **Required Materials**
- Some **Dice**

# General Rules
## Power Class
This is how different miniatures and universes can play together without much trouble.

The **Power Classes** are used to make sure that every miniature in each universe is balanced for a fair fight, *optionally* the classes can be modified at will by the players *as long as all the players agree.*
