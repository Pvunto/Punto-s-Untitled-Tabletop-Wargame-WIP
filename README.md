# Introduction
This **Tabletop Wargame** was created to allow both experienced and novice players to participate in a simple and  **customizable**  experience. 
Everything written in these files is not holy text but *can be modified at will by players* without any problems.
Each part is created to allow miniatures from different universes to interact in a way that is *balanced* for all players.

Two to four players can play without any problems.

***If any rules are changed, players must be notified before the game begins.***
## **Required Materials**
- Some **Dice**
- Some **miniatures** or something that symbolizes them
- Tape measure

# General Rules
## Power Class
This is how different miniatures and universes can play together without much trouble.

The **Power Classes** are used to make sure that every miniature in each universe is balanced for a fair fight, *optionally* the classes can be modified at will by the players *as long as all the players agree.*
